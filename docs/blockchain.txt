What are people doing wrong with blockchain.

Two approaches:

* Tech approach - Create tech infrastructure.
** Problem: Lot's of wheel reinvention
** Encourages complicated tech solutions for simple business problems
** All tech pieces available

* Enterprise approach
** Business process optimization
** Fixed against business workflows
** Large company bureaucracy

* Business model issues
** Fixes things to existing workflows
** Last mile problem -  No business efficiencies until everything is
   in place.  Example: If you reduce securities settlement time to
   zero then you have gained no efficiencies if your cash settlement
   time is several days.
** Tech and enterprise approach tries to recover funds directly from
   services, which encourages making services complicated
** Requires buyin from people that are going to get fired if the
   project succeeds

* Key power of blockchain
** Allow efficient flows of information between diverse institutions
** Consortia don't work!!!!  You end up with a shipping blockchain, an
   insurance blockchain, a financial blockchain, which are not
   interoperable.
** Big businesses cannot make sudden strategic shifts.  SME's can.
   But SME's have little capex budgets.
