\begin{abstract}
Recent changes in Hong Kong securities regulation create an opt-in
procedure by which a cryptoexchange that wishes to be regulated by the
Hong Kong regulation can do so by trading a security token.  Motivated
by this regulatory framework, we have created a simple security asset
backed token which can be traded by an exchange which is interested in
being regulated.

In addition to this addition motivation, we hope that

\section{Securities regulatory regime under Hong Kong law}

In contrast to the regulatory regimes in other regions, the definition
of securities in Hong Kong can be expanded only by legislative actions
or by addition of securities to the list of securities.

Hong Kong law also allows the definition of securities by
administration action by the Financial Secretary.  However, there are
legal limitations on the ability for the Financial Secretary to do
so.  Administrative actions by the Hong Kong government are can be
challenged on the grounds of ``natural justice''.  Under general
principles of Hong Kong administrative law, a person adversely
affected by an adminstrative action most be given an opportunity to
challenge that action.

In addition, there are constitutional limitations on the ability of
the Hong Kong to regulate securities.  Article 8 of the Basic Law
requires that any

The result of these limitations is that

\section{Binding problem}

One of the basic issues for virtual assets is to bind to the token to
an owmership right.  A typical example of the binding problem exists
if Alice hands the keys to his house or car to Bob.  In most business
transaction simply handing over the keys to an asset does not result
in an actual transfer of ownership.  Typically both the transferer and
the transferee must go through some legal formality in order to ensure
that there has been in fact a transfer of ownership.

The difficulties in the binding problem can be illustrated by the
following scenario.  Alice runs a cryptoexchange, and has tokens
stolen by Mallory.  Mallory then resells the tokens to Bob who was
unaware that the tokens were stolen.  Alice is unable to locate
Mallory and seeks to recover from Bob.

In most forms of ownership, such as a limited partnership, the
ownership was never transferred from Alice to Mallory, and therefore
Bob does not have proper ownership of the tokens, and Alice can
recover the tokens from Bob.  In the event that Alice is unable to
force Bob to return the tokens, Alice can obtain an injunction
preventing Bob from enjoying any of the benefits of holding the
tokens.

However, if the Alice and Bob are beficienaries of a trust, no
ownership has been transfered.  Hence, if Mallory were to steal tokens
from Alice, Alice could bring an equitable action of unjust enrichment
against Mallory, but if those tokens were transfered in good faith to
Bob, Alice would not have the ability to recover tokens from Bob or to
prevent Bob from enjoying the benefits of holding the tokens.
